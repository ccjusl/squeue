If you're reading this then I suppose you are preparing for your upcoming placement season . Your curious mind might be interested to know about the intricacies of coding rounds and corresponding tech-interviews . Trust me it's completely normal to feel clueless , been there , felt that . But bear with me till the end of this and I'm sure all of your confusions will subside .

Amazon visited our campus in the first week of September , 2020 . Only the circuital branches were allowed to sit for the coding round .

##Round 1

This was conducted on **AMCAT** and had four sections .

1. **Debugging Section** - Probably the easiest of the lot , basic code debugging in the language of your choice.

2. **Coding Section** - This had two standard questions , one on **linked-lists** similar to [merge two sorted linked lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/) and the other on **backtracking**/**dp-memoization** (a new question but on the easier side). The time limit for this section was 70 mins .

3. **Aptitude Section** - This section had mathematical puzzles , logical reasoning questions , paragraph questions and some miscellaneous .One or two questions were tricky , rest all were doable .

4. **Psychometric Test** - This was a round to test our personality and leadership skills .

This went quite well for me. 

41 students were selected for the next personal interview round .

##Round 2

This round took place two days after the coding round's results . The interviews were conducted virtually (Surpised , eh?) on **Amazon Chime** . The interviewer was friendly and greeted me warmly . He introduced himself and then asked me to introduce myself . He wasted no time and directed jumped to the technical questions . I had done a project in **React Native** and we had a thorough discussion on my project and the technologies used for about 10 minutes . He was satisfied with my answers so he moved to the **DSA** questions . 

1. He started with a simple question on [binary search trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/) . He wanted to see whether I was comfortable in writing readable code using pointers . Then he wanted me to **check whether each node's value in a binary tree is equal to the sum of it's left and right subtree** . At first I gave him a brute force approach , he asked me to code it and check for certain corner cases . Then he asked whether I can optimize my solution , I replied in affirmative and was lucky enough to arrive at an optimal solution . He asked me to derive the time and space complexity . I did so using Master Theorem . Then he moved onto the next question .

2. The question was kind of similar to **using atmost k flips maximize the length of substring having all 0's or 1's in the given string and return its length** . I directly gave him the optimal approach using **two-pointers** and a **queue** . He was satisfied and wanted me to code it , so I wrote the code with proper comments and took care of all the edge cases . He asked me to explain the working of the code using a test case of my own . I did few dry runs and explained him the working of my code . He was satisfied .

Then he asked me whether I had any questions for him . I asked for his feedback on my interview , he started laughing and told that the HR will give me my feedback later .Then I asked him about his projects and his interests .

The interview ended with him wishing me good luck .

The results came late in the night, the same day and I was lucky to be selected as a summer intern . 

##Tips 

- **Practice** a lot , know your preferred language like the back of your hand . 

- Practice writing **production ready code** .

- Be **confident** and trust yourselves .

- **Think out loud** during interviews , even if you're unable to solve something during an interview having a *clear* approach and making your approach known to the interviewer is good for you .

- Build your **problem solving** skills .

- **Enjoy** ! This placement season comes once in a lifetime , give your 100% and do not lose hope .
